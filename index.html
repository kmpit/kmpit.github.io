				<h3>Personal Website<h3>
				<h4>Personal Project | Apr - May 2020</h4>
				<p>Designing and developing a fully responsive site to hone the skills I'm passionate about.</p>

				<p><strong>Skills: </strong>Design for mobile & desktop, copywriting, responsive frontend web development
				<br><strong>Tools: </strong>Dev: HTML, CSS, JS; Design: Pen and paper, Figma</p>
	
				<p>In creating this site, I've leveled up my design and development skills in so many ways.
					Here's a bit of my process:
				</p>
	
				<ul>
					<li>Started with a desire to completely redesign my personal website and a bunch of ideas of what I wanted:</li>
				</ul>
	
				<div>
					<img class = "single wide" src = "images/projects/website/001.jpg">
				</div>

				<ul>
					<li>Stepped back to research priorities of users (employers and peers)
						via career development resources and a survey of best-in-class personal websites; 
						this research defined key elements such as the order of contents</li>
					<li>Sketched numerous design alternatives for each section, leveraging techniques such as Crazy 8s to spark creativity</li>
				</ul>

				<p class = "caption">A few examples of early sketches for the Projects section are below (though there are more where these came from!)</p>

				<div>
					<img class = "single wide" src = "images/projects/website/projects0.jpg">
				</div>

				<ul>
					<li>Selected best aspects of various design alternatives and used Figma to flesh out realistic options for selection</li>
				</ul>

				<p class = "caption">For the Experience section, I prototyped three key design options.</p>

				<div>
					<img id = "exp1" class = "side_by_side half" src = "images/projects/website/exp1.PNG">
					<img class = "side_by_side half" src = "images/projects/website/exp2.PNG">
					<img class = "single wide" src = "images/projects/website/exp3.PNG">
				</div>

				<p class = "caption">I selected Option C because it best allows for both a 
					high-level overview and detailed job descriptions, both of which research showed to be important. 
					Peers also responded positively to the time-based structure and interactivity.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Coded site in HTML, CSS, and JS, problem-solving to implement features such as snap-scrolling mobile carousel (Experience), responsive cards (Project)</li>
					<li>Iterated on designs to improve appearance and usability based on continuously sourced feedback</li>
					<li>Tested thoroughly to ensure strong functionality and appearance in all device sizes, browsers</li>
					<li>Assessed usability of final site with user tests and iterated based on results; for example, mitigated user confusion
						by adding scrollbar to modal</li>
				</ul>

				<p>I learned a ton about design and development from this project. For example:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>When designing for an informational site, it's important to fully account for the content to be delivered; 
						unlike web apps, where content appears in consistent formats, informational content may be any length, 
						and the design must properly frame and support content of all lengths</li>
					<li>The size of content relative to the screen is another hugely important parameter to consider early in design</li>
					<li>An organized approach to styling and repsonsive breakpoints saves you time down the road</li>
					<li>'Cool' things, like buttons that jump up on hover, are easy to code;
						the more difficult, but more important, aspects of a site are the ones you don't notice, 
						like proper margins and spacing across all browser sizes</li>
				</ul>

				<p>I can't wait to keep improving on this site and to continue building my skills so that I can build 
					even more functional and beautiful sites in the future.

				<br><strong>Tools: </strong>Iterative design process, QFD, persona, Solidworks, 3D printing
				<br><strong>Collaborators: </strong>Conrad Heidebrecht, Katrina Hermanns, Sylvia George, Jack Yu, Vlad Hociota</p>

					<li>Headed physical product design, including creation of MFP through modeling in Solidworks and 3D printing</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Our thorough design process led to a well-researched final product, from user research to concept development to iterating on the final prototype.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Started by exploring current solutions and frustrations via user surveys; results informed us that both digital and physical systems served certain needs, but users felt current solutions were easy to forget, difficult to use</li>
